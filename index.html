    <h2>Play is <br>important:</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
  <li>First, play is a natural way for our brains to explore and experiment with new ideas and concepts. When we engage in playful activities, we are often more open to taking risks and trying new things, which 
    can lead to innovative solutions and creative break throughs.</li>
  <li>Second, play can help us overcome creative blocks and mental barriers. When we approach a problem with a playful attitude, we are less likely to get stuck in rigid thinking patterns or feel constrained by self-imposed 
    limitations.</li>
  <li>Third, play can also be a source of inspiration and motivation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Overall, incorporating play into the creative process can help us tap into our imagination and explore new possibilities, leading to more innovative and fulfilling creative work.</p>
